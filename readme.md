## WristBand Module for NARI
This code acts as a wristband module for Raspberry Pi.
It also has a blackbook that gives you the intuition about how the project works.
It also consists of the Android ASync class which connects to the wristband module using Socket Programming

## Applications
The main application is aimed at providing safety for women in India. This module manages to act as a perfect fitness tracker as well as a rescue module.

### Code Requirements
The example code is in Python ([version 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) or higher will work). 

### Dependencies

1) import cv2
2) import immutils
3) import dlib
4) import scipy


### Description

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

### Algorithm

Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye:.
